Core functionality is implemented in the following files:

`adapters/bias_sampling.py`: hybrid knobs definition
`adapters/condigspace/low_embeddings.py`: random linear projections (can also be combined with bucketization and biased sampling)
`adapters/configspace/quantization.py`: knob values bucketization
`space.py`: constructs the optimizer's input space
`optimizer.py`: optimizer initialization
`run-smac.py`: main script used for experiemnts (feedback loop)
